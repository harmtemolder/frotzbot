VMs are the wrappers that run the games, expect input and give output.

They must implement these functions:

handleInput(input) -> Handle player input (like 'look' and 'gamelist').

setOutputHandler(handler) -> A one-time setter for a function that you can use to output strings to the player. This will be called by the starter.

start() -> Do something to start the VM. Will be called before everything else.
